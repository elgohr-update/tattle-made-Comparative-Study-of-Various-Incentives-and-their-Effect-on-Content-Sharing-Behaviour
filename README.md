# Comparative Study of Various Incentives and their effect on Content Sharing Behaviour

This joint project with [Monk Prayogshala](https://www.monkprayogshala.in/) aims to understand the possibility and effectiveness of web based monetization as a mechanism to promote sharing of better quality information in online spaces as opposed to vanity metrics like likes and follower counts. 

As part of this project we also plan to build and share the source code of a web service that people could self host in their communities. This would enable anyone to create an online content platform that rewards its community members for sharing and engaging with their content without tracking their data.
